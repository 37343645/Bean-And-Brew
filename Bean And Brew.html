  <h1> What we do</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:left;">Bean and Brew were one of the first companies in the UK to use fair-trade coffee and all organic milk for their products. Each drink is made exactly to your specifications, for a personal service. We also offer trademarked flavoured coffees, breakfast items such as porridge, small sweet treats, and pressed sandwiches. We have also added frappes and fruit smoothies in addition to seasonal treats such as the pumpkin spiced latte (for Halloween) and various assorted baked goods.</p>
